For the moment this readme will just serve as a though bubble. Meaning stuff that comes to my mind while thinking about th eproject will be put here as in not to forgot yet still to remember.

## Center of Lighthouse

So even if you find the center and the orientation of the lighthouse correctly. The problem comes when you want to orient the system. Even a small error in the angle will result in the greater position error in 2m distance. lets say 1° will result in a 0,03m error in that plane
So this error matters for when the vive is referenced to another system lets say the robot. How to get around it? Make the point of reference close to the Vive so if its 10cm instead of 200cm, the error for 1° will be just 1,5mm. 


How to solve this problem? Well make the way we measure in this system depend on the orientation of the lighthouse. But main problem here is how to reliable orient the LH in the same manner when fastening it. Can we use the 2 screws?
Like screw in the bottom and then screw in the back to really align the 2?
