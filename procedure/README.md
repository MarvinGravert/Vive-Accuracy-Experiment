# Procedure of experiment to measure accuracy

The procedure is broken up into 

## Baseline Preperation Positioning for Tripod experiments

1. Mount the Lighthouses at elevated positions at the edges of the workspace. For all experiments this position was noted down and publish along with the raw data
2. Place the Tripod on which the Vive is mounted together with the connector plate on the workspace corner which will be signified as workspace origin. Using the tripod, a level position with the ground is attempted to be achieved
3. Starting with the origin position on the connector plate and then along the x and y axis respectively measure the position of the laser targets
4. Perform a test measurement at the y axis point to verify that the new coordinate system has been set correctly. Do the same for the origin position
5. The Tripod setup is moved within the workspace at each point Vive tracker position data is recorded as well as the 4 target position. 

## Baseline Preperation Positioning for Robot Experiments

1. Mount the Lighthouses at elevated positions at the edges of the workspace. For all experiments this position was noted down and publish along with the raw data
2. Mount the connector plate on the end effector and place Vive tracker and target holders 
3. Starting
