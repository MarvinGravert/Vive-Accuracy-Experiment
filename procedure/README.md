# Procedure of experiment to measure accuracy

The procedure is broken up into 

## Baseline Preperation Positioning

1. Mount the Lighthouses at elevated positions at the edges of the workspace. For all experiments this position was noted down and publish along with the raw data
2. Place the Tripod on which the Vive is mounted together with the connector plate on the workspace corner which will be signified as workspace origin. Using the tripod, a level position with the ground is attempted to be achieved
3. Starting with the origin position on the connector plate and then along the x and y axis respectively measure the position of the laser targets
4. Now the position is set as the starting position. Also noted down for the Tracker
